Here’s Gartner’s most recent ranking in 2020: In this Tableau for Beginners course, you will learn everything you need to get started with this wonderful visualization and business intelligence tool. You’ll be able to build charts like bar charts, line charts (for working with time series data), pie charts, and even get the hang of geospatial analysis using map visualizations in Tableau! Note: If you’re looking to build and master dashboards and storyboards in Tableau, make sure you check out the popular ‘Mastering Tableau from Scratch: Become a Data Visualization Rockstar’ course! Why should you use Tableau? Tableau, as we mentioned above, is the gold standard in analytics and business intelligence. It is a widely used tool in the industry, both in big firms as well as startups. Tableau helps us create effective, impactful and beautiful dashboards and stories that our clients and stakeholders love. There are a ton of job vacancies for Tableau professionals in the industry so this is a great time to get started. Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public - which one should I choose? Tableau Desktop and Tableau Public are two of the many offerings by Tableau. Tableau Desktop is the premium version of Tableau Public. It is used by organizations worldwide for their analytics and business intelligence projects. You will be working with Tableau Desktop in the industry. Tableau Public, on the other hand, is a free platform to learn Tableau. It was created with the purpose of making the broader audience comfortable with Tableau and how it works. Tableau Public offers almost all the features of Tableau Desktop (except you can’t save your work on your local machine - it will be uploaded to Tableau’s public gallery). You can perform all the work provided in this course in Tableau Public. What are the different tools under the Tableau umbrella? Tableau offers a variety of tools catering to different organizations and solutions: And many other tools you can check out on Tableau’s official website. Where can you learn about the intermediate-level of Tableau? Excellent question! We recommend taking the ‘Mastering Tableau from Scratch: Become a Data Visualization Rockstar’ course to deep dive into Tableau. You will learn how to quickly convert your data into actionable insights, create dashboards to impress your clients, and learn Tableau tips, tricks and best practices in your day-to-day role. Can I use Tableau for time series forecasting? Yes, you can. Tableau has an in-built feature for forecasting where you can use the concept of moving average to build forecasts. But keep in mind that this is a crude feature and might not be reliable for your business. Time series is a complex topic and has advanced beyond moving average. However, Tabelau’s forecast feature does give you a rough idea of what to expect and might work for small businesses or if you’re looking for a quick idea of what to expect from your sales numbers, for example. Do you need to know programming to learn Tableau? Not at all. Tableau thrives as a drag-and-drop tool (for the most part). That’s the beauty of Tableau to be honest, you can quickly get started and build awesome visualizations without having to get into any coding or programming. But knowing simple Excel formulas, such as IF-ELSE, will help you with feature engineering in Tableau. And that is a critical part of a business intelligence analysts skillset. What kind of projects can you perform using Tableau? You can take up all sorts of analytics projects next. We suggest heading over to the DataHack platform and picking up any project that catches your interest.

Title: Introduction to Web Scraping using Python; Description: The need and importance of extracting data from the web is becoming increasingly loud and clear. There is an unprecedented volume of data on the internet right now - and data science projects often need this data to build predictive models. That’s a key reason why data scientists are expected to be familiar with web scraping. We have found web scraping to be a very helpful technique for gathering data from multiple websites. Some websites these days also provide APIs for many different types of data you might want to use, such as Tweets or LinkedIn posts. But there might be occasions when you need to collect data from a website that does not provide a specific API. This is where having the ability to perform web scraping comes in handy. As a data scientist, you can code a simple Python script and extract the data you’re looking for. So knowing how to perform web scraping using Python will help you go a long way towards becoming a resourceful data scientist. Are you ready to take the next step and dive in? A note of caution here – web scraping is subject to a lot of guidelines and rules. Not every website allows the user to scrape content so there are certain legal restrictions at play. Always ensure you read the website’s terms and conditions on web scraping before you attempt to do it. In this course, we will dive into the basics of web scraping using Python. We will understand what web scraping is, the different Python libraries for performing web scraping, and finally we’ll implement web scraping using Python in a real-world project. There’s a lot to unpack here so enroll today and start learning! We’re sure you’ve asked these questions before. Even if you haven’t, you should start learning how these web scraping questions should be answered: You’ll learn about these concepts inside the course and we have even provided a high-level overview of these questions after the course curriculum below. Who is the Introduction to Web Scraping using Python Course for? This course is for anyone who: What do you need to get started with the Introduction to Web Scraping using Python course? Here’s what you’ll need: That’s it! You’re all set to perform web scraping on your machine! What is web scraping? Web scraping is a computer software technique of extracting information from websites. This technique mostly focuses on the transformation of unstructured data (HTML format) on the web into structured data (database or spreadsheet). You can perform web scraping in various ways, including use of Google Docs to almost every programming language. Why should you learn web scraping? Web scraping is incredibly useful when you don’t have enough data with you to train a machine learning model. Web scraping helps us to collect this data from websites (if permitted) and we can then use that to train our model. You can imagine why web scraping is such a prized tool in a data scientist’s arsenal! Why Python for web scraping? Python is the most popular tool out there in the world for Web Scraping. Its 2 prominent libraries - BeautifulSoup and Scrapy makes web scraping easy and efficient. Python’s syntax makes understanding of the codes easy. Also python provides many other libraries for web scraping which can be used as per our needs. Eg- lxml, requests etc What are the different Python libraries for performing web scraping? There are many libraries in Python that help us to scrape the web. The 3 most prominent libraries include: Can I use R for web scraping? You sure can! You can perform web scraping in both Python and R. We are teaching you how to do this using Python in the course but feel free to use R if that’s your language of choice. You can go through this tutorial that walks you through how to master web scraping using an R package called rvest. Are web scraping concepts asked in data science/machine learning interviews? This depends a lot on the data science role and the organization you’re interviewing for. Not all organizations require you to know or apply web scraping. But here’s why you should learn it anyway - it will help you expand your skillset and also help you work on your personal projects for data science. There’s a lot to learn and nothing to lose!; Curriculum: Introduction to Web Scraping:[What is Web Scraping?,Caution,Popular Libraries for Web Scraping,Components of Web Scraping,AI&ML Blackbelt Plus Program (Sponsored)]|Web Scraping: Procedure |Scraping URLs and Email IDs from a Web Page: |Scrape Images in Python:[]|Scrape Data on Page Load:[]
